## Optimization of Merchandising Processes in an Outsourcing Services Company

### Introduction
In the merchandising process, tasks are received from customers and merchandisers fill out questionnaires, take "Before" and "After" photos, and save the information. Operators then process all questionnaires, including those from previous days, and prepare the data for customers. The process of processing one customer's information can take several hours. Additionally, there is a field in the packages called "Comments," where merchandisers can provide feedback. However, sometimes these comments are written in different languages or contain inappropriate content, requiring operators to edit the comments before they can be shared with the customer.

### Implemented Optimizations
- Automated Questionnaire Process: The questionnaire process has been optimized by pre-populating questions based on store and product information, reducing the time required to complete the questionnaire.
- Improved Data Management: A centralized database or cloud-based solution has been implemented to improve data management and access for operators.
- Merchandiser Training: Merchandisers have been provided training on high-quality photo taking, accurate questionnaire completion, and effective communication to improve data quality and reduce processing time.

### Pending Optimization
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): The implementation of OCR technology has been deemed difficult and expensive.

### New Optimization (In Process)
- Automated Report Processing: Automatic processing of reports in Excel using Python has been implemented to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the data processing stage.
- Automated Comment Processing: NLP algorithms can be used to process comments and identify key information, such as sentiment and topics, improving data analysis.

### Conclusion
With the implementation of these optimizations, the company continues to improve the efficiency and accuracy of its merchandising processes, resulting in better customer satisfaction and increased revenue. The implementation of automatic report processing using Python has the potential to further streamline the data processing stage.
